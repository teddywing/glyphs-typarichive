2. Moves the original file to an `_archive` directory
3. Opens the new font file
4. Updates a timestamp in the font family name


## Install
Download [typarichive.py][2] and put it in the `~/Library/Application
Support/Glyphs/Scripts` directory.

In Glyphs, hold the Option key and select the _Script > Reload Scripts_ menu
item.
